# Error Fixes Documentation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP) Violations

**Problem**: Scripts from external domains (infird.com) and blob URLs were being blocked by CSP.

**Solution**: Updated the CSP in `index.html` to include:
- Added `https://infird.com` to `script-src` and `script-src-elem` directives
- Added `https://infird.com` to `img-src`, `connect-src`, and `frame-src` directives

**Files Modified**:
- `index.html` - Updated CSP meta tag

### 2. 404 Errors for Booking Resources

**Problem**: The application was trying to fetch booking details that don't exist, causing 404 errors.

**Solution**: 
- Created a new `bookingService.js` with centralized error handling
- Added response interceptors to handle 404 errors gracefully
- Updated all booking-related components to use the new service
- Added proper error handling and logging

**Files Modified**:
- `src/services/bookingService.js` - New service file
- `src/pages/MyBookings/BookingList.jsx` - Updated to use new service
- `src/pages/Home/TravelOffers.jsx` - Updated to use new service

### 3. Deprecated CSS Properties

**Problem**: `-ms-high-contrast` CSS properties are deprecated and causing console warnings.

**Solution**: Added modern `forced-colors-mode` support to replace deprecated properties.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/index.css` - Added modern forced-colors-mode support

## Key Improvements

### Error Handling
- All API calls now have proper error handling
- 404 errors are logged but don't break the application
- Authentication errors automatically redirect to login
- Timeout handling for API requests (10 seconds)

### Service Layer
- Centralized booking API calls in `bookingService.js`
- Automatic token management
- Consistent error handling across components
- Better logging for debugging

### Performance
- Reduced unnecessary API calls
- Better state management for bookings
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

## Testing

To test the fixes:

1. **CSP Issues**: Check browser console for any remaining CSP violations
2. **404 Errors**: Monitor network tab for any remaining 404 errors
3. **CSS Warnings**: Check console for any remaining deprecated CSS warnings

## Future Recommendations

1. Consider implementing retry logic for failed API calls
2. Add user-friendly error messages for common failures
3. Implement offline support for better user experience
4. Consider using React Query or SWR for better data fetching
